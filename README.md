  [See it on Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1091671)

LeXY is a 3D Printer, with the ability to exchange the extruder with a Laser module. I'm working in this project since late 2014, and now, after several trial and error tests, I think that the reliability reached the desired level... I will maintain the "Work in progress" state because is a live project constantly improved...
